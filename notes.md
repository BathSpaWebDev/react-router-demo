In react we handle forms slight differently yto a vanilla js / html page.

In react we store the input values in State, and keep that state updateing as we are filling in the form , using an onChange event.

So with a normal form, you would submit capture the data only at the end, when you submit.

In react you update the data as state as you go along, then when you submit the form you do something with that state.
